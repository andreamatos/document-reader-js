## Running the Server with http-server

To run your website locally and avoid CORS issues, you can use the `http-server` package. Follow these steps:

1. **Install http-server globally**:

    You need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you havenâ€™t installed Node.js, please do so before continuing.

    Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```

2. **Navigate to your project directory**:

    If you aren't already in your project directory (where your `index.html` file is located), run:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/my-website
    ```

3. **Start http-server**:

    Run the following command to start the server:

    ```bash
    http-server
    ```

    By default, this starts a server on port 8080. You can access your website at `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Disable CORS (if necessary)**:

    The `http-server` should handle CORS issues out of the box. However, if you need to explicitly disable CORS, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    http-server --cors
    ```

    This will allow all cross-origin requests.
